Peer's project: Apollo's branching novel

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

	I learned more about this way of making "rooms" in this type of game.

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

	I'd like to work more with the dictionaries and the while statement at the bottom.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

	Make sure to go through all the paths to ensure that they work!

What could have been clearer or better commented?

	It was fairly easy to rad, but I would like to know more about some of the paths and where they lead.

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

	Not in particular.

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

	The readme was changed for this peer review so I would like a more in depth about the game itself.

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
	
	I enjoyed the comedy found in it, as well as the while statement at the bottom. The organization was easy to read.
